# Full Stack Open 2023 - Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development by University of Helsinki

This repository contains my assignment submissions for [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) a course offered by University of Helsinki.

This course focuses on building modern web applications with JavaScript, the main technology that this course aims to teach is React (mainly consuming REST APIs built with Node.js). The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a more modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course also contains additional sections for the following:

* TypeScript, an open-source typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
* React Native, an open-source UI software framework to create native mobile applications using JavaScript.
* CI/CD, Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD)
* Docker and Docker Containers, an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications by virtualizing the operating system of the computer on which it is installed and running.
